__ExtJS 5/6 : Simple approach for global languages (i8n)__

## Introduction

This works was inpired by the translation approach in Symfony 2, based on YAML files. 
On a daily use, I'm still using YAML for the raw strings, with a couple of macros to translate YAML to JSON and integrates it directly in 'Lang' class.

## Usage
